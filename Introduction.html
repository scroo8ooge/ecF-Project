The entire world's mathematical knowledge is contained in about 100 million pages of mathematical
articles and books. Contrary to all other sciences, mathematical knowledge does not age, and consequently, mathematical results found 100 or even 200 years ago are still of relevance today.
The International Mathematical Union and the US National Research Council are currently evaluating
the possibility and potential form of a future World Heritage Digital Mathematics Library. Existing digital
mathematics libraries like the European Digital Mathematics Library currently only collect older mathematical articles and books. A future digital mathematical library should index pure mathematical content
including theorems, mathematical identities, and definitions from the original literature without requiring
the user to read through the original papers or books.
